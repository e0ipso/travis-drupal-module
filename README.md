# Travis Drupal Module
This project aims to provide nice and simple CI setup for your Drupal module repository.

If you have a Drupal module in GitHub and want to run tests and code quality inspections without the
hard work of discovering the tools and setting this up yourself, then this tool is for you.

Go to the root of the repo for your module and run:

```
composer require e0ipso/travis-drupal-module
```

You are done. Yes, really.

Enable the [Travis integration](https://travis-ci.com) for the repo, and see it work.
